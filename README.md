### Project Ten - 100DaysOfCode
# Weight Converter
This is a simple program that accepts a weight value from a user in either Pounds or Kilogram, and converts it to the other.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Create a variable to hold the user input and converted weight.
3. Create a variable to hold the current weight measure from the user.
4. Use if statements to evaluate the user input from both step 2 and 3. Where invalid inputs are entered, prompt the user. Error handling is another python technique that can be used here.
5. Use if statements to perform the appropriate math operation to convert the weight value.
8. Print the converted weight value.
9. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* I explored the use of error handling in Python for the first time instead of a series of if statements to catch an error. I'm exploring it more.

For more understanding on Error Handling, **[read](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)** the full documentation.
